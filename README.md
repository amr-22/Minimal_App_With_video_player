# minimal_app_with_video_player




## The video_player package in Flutter doesn't work with YouTube videos
- because YouTube doesn't provide direct access to the video files in a simple, downloadable format that can be played like a standard video file (`.mp4`). 
- Instead, YouTube uses advanced streaming protocols like **DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)** and **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)** to serve their content.
- These formats split the video into small chunks and adapt to the viewer's internet speed, ensuring smoother playback. 

- Moreover, many YouTube videos are **DRM (Digital Rights Management)** protected, meaning they are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access or distribution.
- Because of this, direct access to the video file itself is restricted, and you can't just get a direct video URL like you would for a normal file stored on a server.

- The `video_player` package is designed to play standard video formats such as `.mp4` or `.avi` that are either stored locally or have a direct URL. 
- It does not have built-in support for handling complex streaming protocols like DASH or HLS, nor does it manage the decryption or special access controls required by YouTube.

- To play YouTube videos, you need to use packages like `youtube_player_flutter`, which are specifically designed to work with YouTube’s system, 
- or embed YouTube’s video player in a `WebView`.
- These tools integrate with YouTube’s platform and API to properly handle the streaming protocols and restrictions.

## detailed documentation

### **Overview**

This Flutter application plays a video using the `video_player` package.
It includes functionality  :-
- to load a video from a network URL,
- display the video,
- control playback (play/pause),
- and show a loading indicator while the video is initializing.

### **Key Components:**
1. **`VideoPlayerController`**: Manages the video playback (initialize, play, pause, etc.).
2. **`FutureBuilder`**: Used to manage the asynchronous initialization of the video player.
3. **`FloatingActionButton`**: Provides a play/pause control for the video.

---

### **Code Documentation**

##### **Variables:**
```dart
late VideoPlayerController _controller;
late Future<void> _initializeVideoPlayerFuture;
```
- **`_controller`**: Manages the video (play, pause, load).
- **`_initializeVideoPlayerFuture`**: A `Future` that tracks the video initialization process (used in `FutureBuilder` to ensure the video is ready before being displayed).

##### **`initState()` Method**
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/videos/butterfly.mp4');
  _initializeVideoPlayerFuture = _controller.initialize();
  _controller.setLooping(true);
}
```
- **Purpose**: Initializes the video player when the widget is first created.
  - **`_controller`**: Initializes the video player using a network URL. 
  - **`_controller.initialize()`**: Asynchronously loads the video.
  - **`_controller.setLooping(true)`**: Makes the video loop continuously.
  
##### **`dispose()` Method**
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  if (_controller.value.isInitialized) {
    _controller.dispose(); // Safely dispose the controller
  }
  super.dispose();
}
```
- **Purpose**: Disposes of the `VideoPlayerController` to free up resources when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
  - Always check if the controller is initialized before calling `dispose()` to avoid potential crashes.

  
##### **`FutureBuilder`**
```dart
body: FutureBuilder(
  future: _initializeVideoPlayerFuture,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
      return AspectRatio(
        aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
        child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
      );
    } else {
      return const Center(
        child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
      );
    }
  },
),
```
- **Purpose**: Waits for the video to finish initializing.
  - **`FutureBuilder`**: Displays different widgets based on the state of the `Future`.
    - **`if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done)`**: Displays the video player if the video is ready.
    - **`else`**: Shows a loading spinner while the video is still initializing.

##### **`FloatingActionButton`**
```dart
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    setState(() {
      if (_controller.value.isInitialized) {
        if (_controller.value.isPlaying) {
          _controller.pause();
        } else {
          _controller.play();
        }
      }
    });
  },
  child: Icon(
    _controller.value.isInitialized && _controller.value.isPlaying
        ? Icons.pause
        : Icons.play_arrow,
  ),
),
```
- **Purpose**: A button to toggle between play and pause states.
  - **`onPressed()`**: When the button is pressed, it pauses the video if it's playing, and plays it if it's paused.
  - **`setState()`**: Ensures the UI is updated when the video starts or stops.
  - **Icon**: Displays either a play icon (`Icons.play_arrow`) or a pause icon (`Icons.pause`) based on the video’s state.
